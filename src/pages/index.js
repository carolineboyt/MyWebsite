        <p>My name is Caroline Boyt, and I am a recent graduate of Clemson University with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. During my time at Clemson, I was heavily involved with Clemson University Choirs, Pi Beta Phi Fraternity for Women, and the Paw Pantry, a student-run free food pantry dedicated to fight food insecurity among Clemson's student body. I am passionate about creating music, helping anyone who needs it, and lifting up marginalized voices in my community.</p>
        <p>I chose to pursue a career in Software Engineering to create websites, apps, and other technologies that can help communities in need. My ultimate goal is to start a company that helps small businesses run by members of marginalized communities establish online presences that will help them succeed.</p>
        <p>I am beginning my career as an Associate Software Engineer at Arccos Golf, a company that develops connected golf products. I will be working on their subscriber web portal, and am looking forward to learning more about full-stack web development in this role.</p>
